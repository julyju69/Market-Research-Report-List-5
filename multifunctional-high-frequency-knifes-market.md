<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Multifunctional High Frequency Knifes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Monopolar Circuit</li><li>Bipolar Circuit</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The multifunctional high-frequency knives market is primarily segmented into monopolar and bipolar circuits. Monopolar circuit knives utilize a single electrode, allowing current to pass through the patient’s body to a grounding pad, making them suitable for cutting and coagulation. In contrast, bipolar circuit knives consist of two electrodes that transmit current only between themselves, minimizing surrounding tissue damage and providing precise tissue control. Both types are widely used in surgical procedures for efficient and accurate tissue management.</p></p>
