<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Lean NOx Traps (LNT) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active LNT</li><li>Passive LNT</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Lean NOx Traps (LNT) are emissions control technologies designed to reduce nitrogen oxides (NOx) in exhaust gases from lean-burn engines. The market for LNTs is segmented into active and passive types. Active LNT systems utilize additional fuel or a secondary oxidation process during regeneration, ensuring optimal NOx reduction under varying operational conditions. Conversely, passive LNTs rely on the natural fluctuations in exhaust temperatures and compositions to facilitate regeneration, making them suitable for more stable operating environments. Both contribute to meeting stringent emission regulations.</p></p>
