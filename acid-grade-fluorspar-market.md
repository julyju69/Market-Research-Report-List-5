<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Acid Grade Fluorspar Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CaF2 ≥98%</li><li>CaF2 ≥97%</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Acid Grade Fluorspar is categorized based on its calcium fluoride (CaF2) content, with two common types being CaF2 ≥98% and CaF2 ≥97%. CaF2 ≥98% is considered high purity fluorspar with minimal impurities, making it suitable for use in industries like chemical manufacturing and metallurgy. CaF2 ≥97% is slightly lower in purity but still high grade, often used in the production of aluminum, ceramics, and glass. Both types are important for various industrial applications due to their high fluoride content.</p></p>
