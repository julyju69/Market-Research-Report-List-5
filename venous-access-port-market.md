<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Venous Access Port Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PICC</li><li>Centrally Inserted Catheters (non-tunnelled and tunnelled)</li><li>Implanted Ports</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The venous access port market encompasses various types, including Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters (PICC), centrally inserted catheters (both non-tunneled and tunneled), and implanted ports. PICC lines are inserted into peripheral veins and provide long-term venous access. Non-tunneled catheters are directly inserted into a large central vein for short-term use, while tunneled catheters are surgically placed for longer durations, reducing infection risk. Implanted ports are subcutaneously placed devices for intermittent access. Other variations include various catheter types tailored for specific patient needs.</p></p>
