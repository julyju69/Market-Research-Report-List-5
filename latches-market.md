<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Latches Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>D-Type</li><li>SR- Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Latches are fundamental digital storage elements that retain information based on input conditions. The D-Type latch captures the value of the data input (D) when enabled by a control signal and holds it until the next enable cycle. In contrast, the SR-Type latch has two inputs: Set (S) and Reset (R), allowing it to store a binary state by setting or resetting its output. Both types are essential in memory storage and synchronization in digital circuits, offering distinct functionalities.</p></p>
