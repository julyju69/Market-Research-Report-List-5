<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wound Drainage System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Wound Drainage System</li><li>Closed Wound Drainage System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The wound drainage system market comprises two main types: open and closed wound drainage systems. Open wound drainage systems allow fluids to flow freely from the wound into a dressing or collector, promoting healing but increasing infection risk. In contrast, closed wound drainage systems utilize sealed containers connected to the wound via a tube, effectively preventing external contamination and minimizing infection risks while efficiently removing fluid. Both systems are essential in postoperative care and trauma management, catering to specific clinical needs.</p></p>
