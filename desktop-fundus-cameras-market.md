<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Desktop Fundus Cameras Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mydriatic Fundus Camera</li><li>Non-Mydriatic Fundus Camera</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The desktop fundus cameras market is segmented into mydriatic and non-mydriatic fundus cameras. Mydriatic fundus cameras require the use of dilating eye drops to enlarge the pupil, allowing for a wider view of the retina, making them useful for detailed examinations. In contrast, non-mydriatic fundus cameras do not necessitate pupil dilation, enabling quicker and more comfortable imaging, which is advantageous in screening settings. Both types serve crucial roles in diagnosing and monitoring retinal conditions.</p></p>
