<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dry Film Photoresist Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive</li><li>Negative</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The dry film photoresist market is primarily categorized into two types: positive and negative photoresists. Positive photoresists become soluble in the developer upon exposure to UV light, allowing the desired pattern to be transferred onto the substrate. Conversely, negative photoresists harden when exposed to UV light, making the unexposed areas soluble during development. Both types serve critical roles in microfabrication processes, including printed circuit boards and semiconductor manufacturing, catering to different application needs and design requirements.</p></p>
