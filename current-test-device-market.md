<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Current Test Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Clamp Ammeter</li><li>Probe Ammeter</li><li>Fork Ammeter</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The current test device market includes various tools designed for measuring electrical current. Clamp ammeters utilize a clamp mechanism to encircle a conductor, allowing for non-intrusive current measurement. Probe ammeters, on the other hand, require direct contact with the circuit through probes, offering precise readings but generally needing circuit access. Fork ammeters combine features of both, using a fork-shaped design to measure current in a wire without disconnecting it. Each type serves specific needs across different electrical applications.</p></p>
